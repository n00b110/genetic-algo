# Genetic Algorithm for Optimizing SLA Scheduling


## Introduction

In this project, we tackled the challenge of creating a genetic algorithm to enhance the scheduling processes for the Sophisticated Learning Association (SLA). Our aim was to optimize the use of available spaces and match activities with suitable facilitators and times, considering several constraints like room capacities and facilitator preferences.

## Challenges

### Complexity of Fitness Function
Creating a fitness function that could accurately reflect the complexities of our scheduling requirements was no small feat. The function needed to account for various factors including room sizes, facilitator preferences, and potential conflicts in scheduling.

### Parameter Tuning
Determining the optimal settings for our algorithm—such as how many schedules to generate (population size), how often to introduce mutations (mutation rate), and how long to run the algorithm (number of generations)—required a lot of trial and error. Balancing exploration of new solutions with refinement of promising ones was key to finding a good solution.

### Data Management
Organizing and managing the data for rooms, facilitation times, and other details proved to be quite tricky. Ensuring accurate and efficient access and updates to this data during the genetic operations was critical for maintaining the integrity of our scheduling process.

## Observations on the Schedule Produced

The schedules generated by our algorithm generally met our expectations, aligning well with the specified constraints. Most activities were placed in rooms of appropriate size and with preferred facilitators. However, there were a few instances where high-enrollment activities ended up in smaller rooms, which could be attributed to the inherent randomness in the initial population and mutation stages.

## Suggestions for Improvement

### Enhanced Fitness Function
Improving the fitness function with weighted penalties and rewards could provide a more nuanced guidance to the algorithm, helping it prioritize more critical scheduling needs.

### Adaptive Mutation Rate
An adaptive mutation rate that decreases as the algorithm progresses could enhance both the diversity of the initial solutions explored and the precision of the final solutions by refining the best candidates more thoroughly.

### Parallel Processing
Utilizing parallel processing to evaluate schedule fitness could drastically speed up computations. This would allow us to either run more generations within the same time frame or evaluate larger populations for potentially better solutions.

## Concluding Remarks

This project was an excellent exercise in applying genetic algorithms to solve real-world problems. The results are encouraging, though there's room for further refinement to fully satisfy all the requirements we set out. Looking ahead, combining genetic algorithms with other optimization techniques like simulated annealing or constraint programming might yield even more effective solutions.
